# LJ Code 201 - Day 4

Again I was reminded how useful it is to have people to discuss coding with and complete assignments near. Yesterday I mostly worked in my own bubble on the lab assignments. Compared to the day before when I worked at a table with many of my classmates, I felt like it took me an awfully long time to finish coding the loops into my About_Me JavaScript. Today, though, we had our first pair programming assignment and I felt back in the flow. The coding went faster and felt easier, the assignment felt a lot less overwhelming. It felt whelming. Perfectly whelming.

Things that I've picked up lately that I've appreciated:
 - **learning the difference between declaring a function as a var statement (*var myFunc = function(){};*) and as a block code (*function myFunc(){}*).** The former is compiled at the point it's encountered in the script, the latter is compiled ahead of time. When we pair-programmed functions into my About_Me today, Jose and I converted all of the questions to block-code functions and then slid all the calls to the functions to the top which looked cleaner to me.
 - **array methods in JavaScript**, particularly the *.indexOf* method look promising. I'ma need to find a place to add this one to my code soon.
 - **the position, display, float, and clear attributes in CSS.** We learned these in the tutorials but I halfway understood them then. Now I'm at 75%, but I'm planning to use them to fix my About_Me resume.
