# LJ Code 301 - Day 11

Today we discussed functional programming a little more as well as using IIFEs. I'm feeling a little closer to understanding how and when to use these in our code. As with most of the concepts, the more I can get to use them, the easier it will be to understand them.

We also learned about Page.js and creating single-page apps. Page.js, if I recall correctly, is like a library on the client's side that we can use like a server. In class and in the lab, we just used it to run jQuery statements to show and hide sections of a web page. That was a rather pleasant way to be introduced to this library. It was quick and relatively painless and looked simple on the page. Perhaps it will get a lot more complicated, but having this intro was nice.

I got to pair-program with Rami today which was great. We knocked out the MVP TODOs and moved on to the Stretch Goal and even had time to yammer about food. I appreciated his careful study of each step. He didn't belabor any of the points; he just took his time reading through the programs before moving on. He was also open to me trying stuff to see if it would fail and celebrating our little victories. Huzzah!
