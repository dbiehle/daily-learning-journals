# LJ Code 301 - Day 10

On Friday, we learned about Functional Programming techniques: using functions wrapped in other functions to minimize the amount of code we write to minimize the room for error. The concept in itself is abstract, but putting it into practice is even more so. It's Saturday night while I write this and I've spent some time over the past two days diagramming in my head how best to use these methods. It ain't easy. Though, I can see the horizon where it is.

We've been using the array methods map, filter, and reduce as well as the forEach method to make our programming more functional. I think it's pretty swell that we can chain some of these methods together, but I think that's where I get cloudy in the abstraction. "This method returns an array of... yadda-yadda, which in turn will be filtered down to... yoo-hoo... yadda and then combined into a... yiddly-yoo. Of course!" I've been reading a few other resources online where helpful programmers have tried to explain reduce, map and filter, or all 3. And I think that extra reading is really helping me understand how best to use these methods in our assignments, but I do struggle sometimes with understanding why one might chain a reduce method to a filter method since you can run some filters within a reduce. I bet more exposure will answer that one.
