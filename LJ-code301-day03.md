# LJ Code 301 - Day 3

Today we talked about events in jQuery. How to handle them and how to use them to our advantage. I haven't yet started on my individual portfolio assignment yet, but La and I had trouble with the pair programming assignment. I'm left perturbed. Did we just not understand the concepts or were we having trouble with the pair programming aspect? I'm concerned that the former is the case and that this could be one of those assignments that gnaws on my ass for the week. If it had more to do with La and me as coding partners, that could be harder to fix, but also a worthwhile challenge.

La was the only driver today because we only got through 2 or 3 of the problems. We weren't even half-way finished. And I found myself itching to grab the keyboard from her and start typing up pseudo-code to figure our where to go next. It wasn't until 15 minutes before the assignment was due that I thought to write something out on paper and share it with La, but before we could figure out how best to implement it, we had to ACP and turn in the pull request. I think working on our pair programming could help us speak in code better and learn how to work with other coders' styles. Also the quick turnarounds could give us the impetus to be more clear with each other about what we want and what we need to do.
