# LJ Code 301 - Day 1

Today we learned about responsive web design and how to implement it into a website to make a site more accessible on multiple devices. Teach introduced four tools to achieve more responsive web design: a meta tag for viewport, flexible media, fluid layout/grids, and media queries. Even though I had read about these tools the night before they held no water until we got the chance to use them in our pair programming assignment. The assignment turned out to be rather fun. I enjoyed solving problems using the solutions we just learned. And Quinn made for a great pair-programming partner because instead of spending time wondering whether this was the best way or that was, she just said let's try this way to see what it does and if it doesn't work we'll try the other idea. She is unafraid of making a mistake because, like me, she's just as curious to know what would happen if an error occurs. That's useful and it helps keep the coding progressing instead of standing still.
