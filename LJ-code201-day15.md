# LJ Code 201 - Day 15

Friday we sorted into groups for our final project. I met with Smitty and James to pick a project and figure out how we'll work on it together. We were all champing at the bit to get started, but I think we all have come to value doing lots of preparation before writing the code. I'm very optimistic about this group. Our final product is going to be nifty and we're going to have fun working together and we're going to learn a lot from each other and from applying the techniques we've already learned. We're going to try some new things and sing songs of praise and love every day. Honestly, though, I hear the TAs tell us how often and where we'll fail and what to do when that happens, but I can't really conceive of any of that yet. I look forward to being wrong, though, and learning how to dig ourselves out of the muck and mire.

Is it Monday yet? Is it Monday yet? Is it Monday yet?
