# LJ Code 301 - Day 8

Today we learned how to use SQL and Express to create, retrieve, update, and delete data on a database. Theoretically, this makes a lot of sense. However, in practice, the code is pretty confusing. I've been looking at it on other websites, but I expect that a lot of exposure and practice will be necessary to help. I'm going to spend some time with my pair programming partner tomorrow to go over the code again.

I went to a coding meetup tonight: Beer && Code at Substantial in Capitol Hill. It was a really cool event. I met a bunch of people, all of them very nice and enthusiastic. Some of them employed and some of them looking for work. Although the point of the event was to work on side projects and socialize, most of them were using the event primarily to socialize with other coders. Maybe that's why it was so pleasant. It was also a very welcoming office space. And there was food! I may go again sometime soon.
