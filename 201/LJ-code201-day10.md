# LJ Code 201 - Day 10

Day 10 we learned some error-correcting in class: how to interpret the error messages, how to respond, how to use the console to test different parts of our code. We also learned about the try/catch method for finding errors in functions. This was new to me. I'd created plenty of errors up to this point and used lots of console.logs in my code as well as trying things out in the console. But creating a function to wrap a function looking for errors is novel. I look forward to making my next mistakes in JavaScript so I can try this method.

We also have been learning more CSS and practicing it in our last two labs. I have a tiny bit of experience using CSS, just basic styling of elements of a broad scope. So I enjoyed learning about the pseudo-selectors: pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. A pseudo-class is separated from the selector by a colon and references an event. An example is adding hover to an anchor tag to style a link when the mouse hovers over it. (a: hover {}). A pseudo-element is usually separated from the selector with two colons. An example is referencing the first line of text from a paragraph to add styling to just the first line. (p::firstline {}). To give it a try, I did manage to add the _firstline_ pseudo-element to my Salmon Cookies frontpage.
