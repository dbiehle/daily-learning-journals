# LJ Code 201 - Day 13

Today we learned about persistence of data and how we might be able to use local storage to give our web apps persistence. The idea is that a user could refresh and come back to interact with a page at the same application state. This is a concept that makes a little sense after reading about it, more sense after seeing Stephanie walk us through the use of the localStorage property, but actually makes no sense when I put it into practice.

Okay, that last part is not totally true. I tested a few things and they worked rather well, but I'm having trouble understanding how to use localStorage elsewhere in my code. Is my code too confusing or am I approaching the problem the wrong way? I'm leaning toward the latter. I'm going to take a break and when I come back, I'll knock the problem out. ::mic drop::
