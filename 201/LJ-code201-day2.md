# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

I am really enjoying this class so far. I was a bit trepidatious at first. I heard Brandy call it "imposter syndrome." Yes, that's precisely what I felt, especially after hearing the experience stories from the other members of the cohort and reading the back-and-forth on Slack. And the pre-work introduced me to a lot of new languages and apps. I had to write them all down to just get my head to stop wobbling.

But yesterday was encouraging. The pace felt right. Having a coding task at the end of the day was very helpful for solidifying some of what I've learned so far.

And today's task was even more useful. Today I sat with 6 other members of the cohort while we all completed the task. We gabbed and joked and went on too many tangents, but we also helped each other solve similar problems. And the chatter encouraged more interesting projects.
