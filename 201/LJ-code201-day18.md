# LJ Code 201 - Day 18

Today was all about styling our group project. I spent time in the morning compiling colors and fonts into an HTML/CSS pair that we could then all reference for our project. Then later we used that style-guide to craft the CSS for our site. I think it turned out pretty well, too. I hadn't done that kind of planning before. For the most part when I've added style to web pages I've built, I've done so while building the HTML. The chocolate pizza project was an exception because we knew what the end product should look like; we just needed to figure out, ahead of time, how best to compose the CSS.

That was about all for what I learned today.

I can't speak for the rest of my team, but coding the JavaScript portion has been the most fun and I felt a little sad that I didn't get to work on it at all today.

*Don't worry, sweet JavaScript. I know you've been thinking of me, too. And I'm going to see if I can't work on your code tomorrow. If only to remove pseudo-code. Baby.*
