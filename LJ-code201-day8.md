# LJ Code 201 - Day 8

The concept of objects in JavaScript seems to be a difficult one. When the week started, I was worried that this would be the concept I'd break my skull on. After 3 days of working with objects, though, I feel like the fog is dissipating. The practices are becoming more clear. I can create an object using literal notation or with a constructor. And I can use those objects to update my document object. I struggle with the concept of the prototype, so I need to research this and get some more practice with using the prototype.

I also need to figure out how to add arrays within my salmon cookies functions. I struggled with this on Monday, but I also felt sick, so I cobbled together a work-around. Now it's Wednesday, though. I'm feeling somewhat better, and I need to figure this out so I can accomplish more with my salmon cookies project. Also, just to know how to do it, of course.
