# LJ Code 201 - Day 19

Today we worked on finishing our final project. We had one page that still hadn't been styled with the CSS when we started the day, but we'd met MVP, so while the last page got styled, we worked on stretch goals. Our stretch goals were to add more features and more hikes to our hike finder. The idea was that since we didn't want to implement any stretch goals until we knew that all 3 pages worked, we made sure the functionality of the features could be removed quickly if we met with trouble. However, as it turned out, we were able to finish styling the site and adding in a bunch of new features. Sure, there are things I think all 3 of us would change; tweak this, fix that; but I think we're pleased with the final product. Now, I'm curious if someone will mess with the project tonight. IT AIN'T GONNA BE ME!
