# LJ Code 301 - Day 13

Today we learned about using Heroku to deploy our apps. The process of doing so is a simple one, especially since you can use a GUI and directly connect to your GitHub repo. All that remains is to press a button to open the app. Pretty snazzy.

We also spent some time thinking about the processes we've learned so far in 301:
  * ajax to do some CRUD operations on a page without needing to refresh the whole page
  * single-page applications which mimic multi-page ones but can be quicker to load and easier to manage
  * SMACSS to organize our CSS files and thus our styling architecture
  * Model, View, Controller to organize our JavaScript and better understand the operations
  * node.js and the associated packages like Express to access databases on the server-side
  * Page.js to create client-side routers
  * functional programming to chain operations in JavaScript and simplify for loops
  * Handlebars to make it easier to render data to the page

Oy. I'm sure I'm missing a bunch of things. It's difficult to manage all of these at once, difficult to add them piecemeal to a site while maintaining an understanding of what is happening in our code.
